## This is the description of the project. I am using P5.js
Doing the interactive background, snowflakes, and swinging letter as bonus.
background music is always looping
box appear with sound, as well as sound associated with spinning after click.
I started the project with main.js. Didn't use typescript. So please just npm and local server, no tsc, please.
